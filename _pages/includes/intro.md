I work at City University of HongKong as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** now in HongKong, China.

I received the B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Ning'bo University and Ph.D. degree in Computer Software and Theory from East China Normal University in the group of [Liang Shi](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/_s16/sl2_13905/main.psp).

My research interests include NAND flash memory and computer architecture. Specifically, I specialize in the QoS of high-density flash storage systems.
I have published 21 papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9F9NYH4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Felainelv%2Felainelv.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the international conferences/journals such as TCAD, TACO, HPCA, DAC, DATE, ASP-DAC, ICCD, GLSVLSI, NAS, etc.

I am open-minded and a girl with positive attitude. In my spare time, I like writing blogs, listening to music, traveling, foods, taking photos and vlogs. Playing sports and games are also the choice to relax myself!
